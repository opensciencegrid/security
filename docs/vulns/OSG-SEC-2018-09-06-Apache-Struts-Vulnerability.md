# OSG-SEC-2018-09-06 Apache Struts Vulnerability

Dear OSG Security Contacts, 

This announcement is for sites that still use VOMS-admin from OSG 3.3. Support for OSG 3.3  ended in May 2018 [1].
 
A new vulnerability, described in CVE-2018-11776 [2] has been reported in Apache Struts 2 that potentially allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an impacted server. OSG security team considers patching this vulnerability to be IMPORTANT. 

Please note that this is our best-effort announcement notification. The OSG no longer supports VOMS Admin server, therefore our security team strongly recommends retiring any active servers. Please consult the migration documentation for details [3].

## IMPACTED VERSIONS/ENVIRONMENTS:
Impacted version of VOMS Admin server:
All the versions of VOMS Admin server distributed by the OSG are affected.

Impacted version of Struts: 
- Struts 2.3 - Struts 2.3.34
- Struts 2.5 - Struts 2.5.16

## ACTION RECOMMENDATIONS:
The OSG no longer supports VOMS Admin server, therefore our security team strongly recommends retiring any active servers. 
 
## HOW IT WORKS:
This vulnerability allows for remote code execution when namespace values aren't set for a result defined in underlying configurations and, at the same time, its upper action configuration(s) have a wildcard or no namespace. A possibility for remote code execution also exists when using url tags which don’t have values and actions set and, at the same time, its upper action configuration(s) have a wildcard or no namespace. Proof of concept (PoC) of the exploit is publicly available on GitHub [4].
